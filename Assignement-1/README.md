# Contents:
the first assignement mainly focused on data-wrangling and eda, which includes the given processes
## 1. Data Cleaning
   - Handling duplicates.
   - Treating missing values (numeric: mean/median, categorical: mode).
   - Saving cleaned dataset.

## 2. Descriptive Statistics
   - Summary statistics (mean, median, std, mode).
   - Before vs After imputation comparison (no major distortion observed in the graphs).

## 3. Visualizations
   - Histograms of numerical features.
   - Scatter plot (longitude vs latitude with colour legend as median house value).
   - Boxplots for numerical features (divided into quartiles to detect the outlier points, also note that appropriate scaling must be ensured, as the plot                tends to shift towards bigger values naturally).
   - Distribution comparisons (Before vs After cleaning).
   - correlation heatmap explored among various variables (it follows the Pearson principle of correlation).
   -new feature vectors were added to featurize the data.


# Outcome:
A cleaned and well-structured housing dataset with statistical insights and visual exploration.
